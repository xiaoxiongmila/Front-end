          This is where checkout would occur in a full-blown shopping cart.
          Well, assuming the cart wasn't empty of course.  In real life,
          checking out would require a server, and we don't have one here, so
          this "fake" response constitutes an obligation on your part to
          purchase whatever you've put in your cart... now go to the store and
          hand the nice man or woman at the counter your money... better yet,
          just send it to me (just kidding! ... unless you were writing out the
          check already, because I naturally wouldn't want you to waste one!)
